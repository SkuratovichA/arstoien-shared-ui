# 23-11-2025

[11:05] Copied shared-ui components from the auctions project (/Users/suka-/git/personal/auctions/packages/shared-ui/src/) to the new arstoien-shared-ui repository (/Users/suka-/git/personal/arstoien-shared-ui/src/). The complete directory structure was copied including:
- All 35 UI components in components/ui/ (alert, button, card, form, input, select, etc.)
- Typography components (heading, text)
- 4 context providers (auth-context, user-context, locale-context, exchange-rate-context)
- 4 lib files (utils, apollo-client, i18n, env)
- 1 hook (use-debounce)
- 1 service (exchange-rate.service)
- Generic shared components (mobile-bottom-nav, mobile-notifications-sheet, locale-currency-selector, converted-price, pagination-controls, image-gallery, feature-cards)
- styles/globals.css

Excluded auction-specific components as requested:
- listing-status-badge.tsx
- seller-info-card.tsx

Updated index.ts to remove exports for the excluded auction-specific components (ListingStatusBadge, SellerInfoCard and their associated types). All other exports remain intact.

[11:11] Fixed all import paths throughout the project to use relative imports instead of the package alias:
- Replaced all 27+ instances of '@auction/shared-ui/lib/utils.ts' with relative paths ('../../lib/utils' or '../../../lib/utils' depending on file location)
- Fixed cross-component imports in components/ui/ directory (e.g., form.tsx importing from label.tsx, toaster.tsx importing from toast.tsx and use-toast.ts, alert-dialog.tsx importing buttonVariants from button.tsx)
- Updated typography components (heading.tsx, text.tsx) to use '../../../lib/utils' since they are nested one level deeper
- Fixed apollo-upload-client import in lib/apollo-client.ts:
  - Changed from 'UploadHttpLink' to 'createUploadLink' import pattern
  - Updated to use 'apollo-upload-client/createUploadLink.mjs'
  - Added apollo-upload-client (^18.0.1) to package.json dependencies

All imports now use proper relative paths, making the package self-contained and removing dependency on the @auction alias.
